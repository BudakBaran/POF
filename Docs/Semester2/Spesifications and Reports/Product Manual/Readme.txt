				Product manual Guideline

							

1-) Pie_manual is an examplary product manual to inspire 
    write your own product manual.

2-) User Manual template docx file is much simpler template 
    however, this file template does not satisfy the expected 
    product manual from our lecturers.

3-) You can learn quick tips about how you should write product 
    manual from this website: 

    https://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/usermanuals.html

    But some specifications are not applicaple to our project.
    (That means you should have to use your own logic that to
    decide what decision fits our product manual.)
