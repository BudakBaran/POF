
/// Firstly write a pdf’s and algorithms inside them as you know 
firstly we use a some equations in these pdf not all of them.
 Talk about this stage.

/// Secondly talk about searching problem and 
how we find a solution for this problem 
why we use spatial hashing instead of the other hash algorithms. 
(Some images can be good ask baran not code images).

/// Thirdly talk about our neighbor algorithm and discussion about 
sphere or cubic usage we did this discussion. 
(Give an image for neighbor cell ask baran.)
/// Talk about cell creation way in neighbor and hash algorithm usage.


/// fourthly write our cell creation way (If you think you know algorithm
 you can talk about imaginary cells and imaginary (not storaged) numbers.). 
A little code will be enough. If you do not ask Baran.


/// Ask baran if is there any deficiency or excess 
in there if you think there is, discuss about them 
(But you have to think we should not write all of them for second semester.)

/// Lastly, talk about its not a completed, 
will completed in second semester bla bla bla.

P.S: I think we do not have to talk about
 all code and diagram staffs.

P.S2: Each case have their own test situations 
some of them just a math and others just a code.
P.S3: Ask tests to baran for visualisation
(Probably I’ll not remember in first half hour).
