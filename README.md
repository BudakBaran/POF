# Performance Optimized Fluid (POF)


#### Project Brief Summary
The aim of this project is to research existing methods for creating fluid surface reconstruction 
as of performance quality and seek for a more optimized way to do it.

#### Project Output
* Better performance.
* Better memory efficiency.
* Fluid-like appearance and behaviour.
* Testing of different algorithms for performance and efficiency.
* Higher frame rates per second.

#### Project application areas
* Animations and Movies
* Scientific work
* Games
* Architecture&Construction
